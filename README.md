### 1. How to setup
As written this setup is for docker. So you need to install `docker` and `docker-compose` on your local system / server.

- [Install docker-ce](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Create a folder `/etc/docker-compose` and clone everything from this repository inside.
```bash
mkdir --parents /etc/docker-compose
git clone https://github.com/fisey/papermc-docker.git /etc/docker-compose/minecraft
```

Create a new user with the `uid 4321` without a password.
```bash
adduser --disabled-password --uid 4321 --gecos "" minecraft
```

Create a `minecraft-data` under `/srv/`.
```bash
mkdir --parents /srv/minecraft-data
chown minecraft:minecraft /srv/minecraft-data
```

Build docker container.
```bash
cd /etc/docker-compose/minecraft
docker-compose build
```

Run docker container.
```bash
cd /etc/docker-compose/minecraft
docker-compose up
```


### 2. How to maintain
For example there comes a point where you want to update the version. With docker this is easy. You just need to add two new lines into your `docker-compose.yml`.

*Change version*
```bash
---

version: '3.5'

services:
  minecraft-server:
    build: .
    ports:
    - 25565:25565
    container_name: minecraft-server
    restart: always
    environment:
    - APP_UID=4321
    - APP_GID=4321
    - APP_MEMORY=8192M
    - APP_BUILD=<build_number>
    - APP_VERSION=<build_version>
    volumes:
    - /srv/minecraft-data:/minecraft-data

...
```

*Stop minecraft server*
```bash
cd /etc/docker-compose/minecraft
docker-compose down
```

*Start minecraft server*
```bash
cd /etc/docker-compose/minecraft
docker-compose up
```
